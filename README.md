# InMoov Unity

InMoov Unity is a MyRobotLab replacement, focused only on the InMoov robot.
The idea behind this project is to make an NPC (like in video game) that controls the InMoov robot.

InMoov sensors are used to recreate the real world in the virtual world. That way the robot knows where he can move.

Finally this project is made with many services. Everyone can create its own service.

## Status
The project is in early stage, here is a list of features

- Brain: AIML.Net
- Voice & Speech Synthesis using Microsft `System.Speech.dll`
- Arduino Servo Mixer
- Mecanim to PWM translator (to play Unity animation on the robot)
- Various blank services
