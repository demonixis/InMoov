# Systems

A system is a component that uses one or more services to make something. For instance the Jaw Mechanism uses both ServoMixer and Voice Recognition services to work. Here is a list of systems in the project:


| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Jaw Mechanism | Makes the jaw moves when the robot is talking |
| MecanimTranslator | Allows to play an Unity animation on the robot |
| RandomAnimator | Makes the robot move randomly |
| VRPosses | Allows the user to possess the robot using a VR headset |
